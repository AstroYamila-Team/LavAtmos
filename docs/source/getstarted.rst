Starting a Jupyter Lab environment
----------------------------------

In order to get started with LavAtmos we first need to run the docker
image that contains Thermoengine (see :doc:`installation`). Open your
terminal and change your working directory to wherever you cloned
Thermoengine::

   cd path/to/Thermoengine

Note: make sure to change ``path/to/`` to the actual path on your system.

Next, run the following command::

   ./run_docker_locally.sh

If needed/possible (check with your system admin if applicable) run the above 
command using ``sudo``.
