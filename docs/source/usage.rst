Installation
------------

Since this code uses the MELTS code as provided by the [Thermoengine](https://enki-portal.gitlab.io/ThermoEngine/) 
package, this needs to be installed before LavAtmos may be used. We 
suggest to follow the instructions on the [Thermoengine GitLab page](https://gitlab.com/ENKI-portal/ThermoEngine) 
on how to run a container image locally. Note: This involves installing 
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) onto your system. 

Once you have installed Thermoengine, clone the [LavAtmos repository](https://github.com/cvbuchem/LavAtmos) into the Thermoengine directory.
