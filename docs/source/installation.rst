Installation
============

.. _installation:

Prerequisit packages
--------------------

Since this code uses the MELTS code as provided by the `Thermoengine <https://enki-portal.gitlab.io/ThermoEngine/>`_ 
package, this needs to be installed before LavAtmos may be used. We 
suggest to follow the instructions on the `Thermoengine GitLab page <https://gitlab.com/ENKI-portal/ThermoEngine>`_ 
on how to run a container image locally. Note: This involves installing 
`Docker <https://www.docker.com/get-started/>`_ onto your system. 

Cloning the repository
----------------------

Once you have installed Thermoengine, clone the `LavAtmos repository <https://github.com/cvbuchem/LavAtmos>`_ into the Thermoengine directory using::

    git clone https://github.com/cvbuchem/LavAtmos
