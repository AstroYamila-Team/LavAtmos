Welcome to LavAtmos's documentation!
===================================

**LavAtmos** is a code that performs gas-melt equilibrium calculations 
for a given temperature and melt composition. The thermodynamics of the 
melt are modelled by the MELTS (Ghiorso and Sack 1995) code as presented 
in the Thermoengine package.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
